        <h3>About:</h3>

        <p>Hello, my name is Val Booth and I'm a fourth year computer science major at <a href = "http://www.cs.rit.edu/" class = "rit">RIT</a> 
        who's currently working  as a Software Developer Intern at <a href ="http://www.Hudl.com/">Hudl</a> for the summer through fall of 2015. 
        I'm currently searching for my next internship for the summer through the fall of 2016. </p>
        <p>I have an expected graduation date of May 2017 for a BS in computer science with a minor in Spanish language and Mathematics. Technology 
        stack wise I'm currently enjoying working with Backbone.Marionette as it has the best of both worlds: model-view-controller type design patterns
        and the ability to be enjoyed easily on the web. Even though I'm currently working with Javascript and ASP.net at Hudl I also have working 
        proficiencies, ranked from most to least comfortable, in Java, C, Python, Django and Matlab.</p>
        <p> When I'm not busy with work I enjoy running, playing tennis, and reading Stephen King novels. Feel free to check out my contact 
        information and expand my project sections (by clicking the double down arrow) below.</p>

            A script to calculate and show the equations used to find the GCD then multiplicative inverse (if there is one) for a number in a modular

              Android app that aimed to keep women more safe around RIT's campus. LifeLine had an inconspicuous icon on the homescreen, but within the app it 
              allowed the user to discretely message or call any of three user saved personal contacts, or RIT's public safety. LifeLine was the winner of

              <a href="http://friss.me/">Zach Friss</a>. Bucketeer was a Django web app that allowed users to sign up,
              create bucket lists, cross items off their list, view stats, and earn achievements for completing certain numbers of bucket list items. Bucketeer was the

              <li><span class="sub-project">Connecting Hudl</span>
              Connecting Hudl was a project as part of Hudl's "Mind the Gap" week, a more product/process oriented version of 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project">Skunkworks</a> aimed towards fixing gaps in Hudl and the Hudl project. The Connecting
              Hudl team included <a href="https://github.com/Chastity">Chastity Grant</a>, <a href="https://github.com/majense77">Mike Jensen</a>, and 
              <a href="https://github.com/AWendt54">Austin Wendt</a> and had three parts: a Hudl internal Chrome extension, internal "role" pages, and an internal Wiki.
              The Chrome extension allowed the user to pick a role ("Developer", "Designer", "QA", etc) and view a small extension window of popular links for that role 
              along with company useful internal links. The extension stored the user's role for later visits but still allowed the user to view different pages for 
              different roles. The internal role pages displayed photos for all Hudlies working in that role along with a master list of tools and documentation needed
              for that role. The internal wiki was an installation of MediaWiki and during Mind the Gap the team created/wrote many companywide reaching articles. 
              Connecting Hudl won the 2015 Mind the Gap "Best in Show" award, chosen by Hudlie vote.

              and validating research through sketches and prototypes. The capstone was an in-class project that involved a ten minute user interview followed by a ten
              minute sketch session. An overview of my final, including sketches from my sketch session, can be seen <a href="UX-Cert/index.html">here</a>.</li>

              Operations involved in running an Elasticsearch cluster, and advanced search techniques. The capstone project was to craft an index and search API on any
