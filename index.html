        <h3>About:</h3>

        <p>Hello, my name is Val Booth and I'm a senior computer science major at <a href = "http://www.cs.rit.edu/" class = "rit">RIT</a> 
        who's looking for a challenging full-time position developing software starting summer of 2017. I'm currently on co-op at <a href="http://careers.intuit.com/" class="intuit">Intuit</a> in San Diego, CA until December 2016.</p>

        <p>I have an expected graduation date of May 2017 for a BS in computer science with a minor in Spanish language and Mathematics. I 
        consider myself a full stack engineer, as I'm currently working in Java at Intuit, I worked in Javascript codebases at Hudl, and I 
        developed C code for GE Aviation.</p>

        <p> When I'm not busy with work I enjoy running, enjoying the SoCal beaches, and reading. Feel free to check out my contact 
        information and expand my project sections (by clicking the double down arrow) below.</p>

            SortYourMusic/">“Sort Your Music”</a> that loads a user’s Spotify playlists and rearranges the song order by creating a minimum 
            spanning tree with edge weights based off of song similarity. The similarity between songs is found by comparing beat, volume, and 
            other audio features. Originally written in jQuery for BrickHack 2016 with plans to move more of the source code to the Django 
            backend. Source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/valbooth28/MezcladorMe">here</a> on <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> GitHub.

              allowed the user to discretely message or call any of three user saved personal contacts, or RIT's public safety. LifeLine was the winner of

              <li><span class="sub-project">Connecting Hudl</span>
              Connecting Hudl was a project as part of Hudl's "Mind the Gap" week, a more product/process oriented version of 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project">Skunkworks</a> aimed towards fixing gaps in Hudl and the Hudl project. The Connecting
              Hudl team included <a href="https://github.com/Chastity">Chastity Grant</a>, <a href="https://github.com/majense77">Mike Jensen</a>, and 
              <a href="https://github.com/AWendt54">Austin Wendt</a> and had three parts: a Hudl internal Chrome extension, internal "role" pages, and an internal Wiki.
              The Chrome extension allowed the user to pick a role ("Developer", "Designer", "QA", etc) and view a small extension window of popular links for that role 
              along with company useful internal links. The extension stored the user's role for later visits but still allowed the user to view different pages for 
              different roles. The internal role pages displayed photos for all Hudlies working in that role along with a master list of tools and documentation needed
              for that role. The internal wiki was an installation of MediaWiki and during Mind the Gap the team created/wrote many companywide reaching articles. 
              Connecting Hudl won the 2015 Mind the Gap "Best in Show" award, chosen by Hudlie vote.

              The UX Non-Designers certification was a three week class of one hour sessions on the goals of user experience, methods and strategies of user reasearch,
              and validating research through sketches and prototypes. The capstone was an in-class project that involved a ten minute user interview followed by a ten
              minute sketch session. An overview of my final, including sketches from my sketch session, can be seen <a href="UX-Cert/index.html">here</a>.</li>

              The HudlU Elasticsearch Certification was a four week class where resident Elasticsearch Hudlie experts taught one hour sessions on querying and indexing,
              Operations involved in running an Elasticsearch cluster, and advanced search techniques. The capstone project was to craft an index and search API on any
              data topic. View the overview of my capstone <a href="images/Elasticsearch.pdf"> here</a>, or view my source files
