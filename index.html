        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Val Booth and I'm a senior computer science major at <a href = "http://www.cs.rit.edu/" class = "rit">RIT</a> 
        who's looking for a full-time position developing software starting summer of 2017. I'm currently a co-op at <a href="http://careers.intuit.com/" class="intuit">Intuit</a> in San Diego, CA until December 2016, and previously I was a co-op at Hudl and an intern at GE Aviation.</p>

        <p>I consider myself a full stack engineer as I'm currently working in Java at Intuit, I worked in Backbone.Marionette and React
        JavaScript codebases at Hudl, I developed C code for GE Aviation, and I have done many Python and Django projects as a part
        of my class work.</p>

        <p> When I'm not busy with work I enjoy running, enjoying the SoCal beaches, and reading. Feel free to check out my contact 
        information and expand my project sections (by clicking the double down arrow) below.</p>

            other audio features. Originally written in JavaScript for BrickHack 2016 with plans to move more of the source code to the Django
