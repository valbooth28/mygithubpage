<a id="About" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About:</h3>

<p>Hello, my name is Val Booth and I'm a fourth year computer science major at <a href = "http://www.cs.rit.edu/" class = "rit">RIT</a> who's currently working as a Software Developer Intern at <a href ="http://www.hudl.com/">hudl</a> for the summer through fall of 2015. I'm currently searching for my next internship for the summer through the fall of 2016. I have an expected graduation date of May 2017 for a BS in computer science with a minor in Spanish language and Mathematics. Technology stack wise I'm currently enjoying working with Backbone.Marionette as it has the best of both worlds: model-view-controller type design patterns and the ability to be enjoyed easily on the web. Even though I'm currently working with Javascript and ASP.net at hudl I also have working proficiencies, ranked from most to least comfortable, in Java, C, Python, Django and Matlab. When I'm not busy with work I enjoy running, playing tennis, and reading Stephen King novels. Feel free to check out my projects and contact information below.</p>

  <li> <span class= "sub-project">Modular Multiplicative Inverse Calculator</span> A script to calculate and show the equations used to find the GCD then multiplicative inverse (if there is one) for a number in a modular ring up to 50,000,000. Finding the modular multiplicative inverse is used in practical applications to <a href = "http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/2575/chinese-remainder-theorem-and-rsa">speed up</a> the encryption process of <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/aem1269" > Adam McCarthy</a> for helping test the script. Use the calculator <a href="inverse/index.html">here</a>, or view the source code <a href="https://github.com/valbooth28/valbooth28.github.io/tree/master/javascripts/inverse">here</a> on GitHub.

  <ul>
  <li><span class = "sub-project">LifeLine</span> Created for WicHack 2015 with <a href="https://github.com/allisonsteinmetz">Allison Steinmetz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ror5226">Rachel Rattay</a>, <a href="https://github.com/naina-jain">Naina Jain</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tmw7937">Tiffany Williams</a>, and Kelley Scanlon. LifeLine was an Android app that aimed to keep women more safe around RIT's campus. LifeLine had an inconspicuos icon on the homescreen, but within the app it allowed the user to discretely message or call any of three user saved personal contacts, or RIT's public safety. LifeLine was the winner of WiCHack's "Best Hack for Women" award, and can be seen on Github <a href="https://github.com/naina-jain/LifeLine">here</a>.

  <li><span class = "sub-project">Bucketeer:</span> Created for BrickHack 2015 with <a href="https://github.com/aem1269" >Adam McCarthy</a>, <a href="http://corb.co/">Corban Mailloux</a> and <a href="http://friss.me/">Zach Friss</a>. Bucketeer was a Django web app that allowed users to sign up, create bucket lists, cross items off their list, view stats, and earn achievements for completing certain numbers of bucket list items. Bucketeer was the winner of BrickHack 2015's "Best Use of Digital Ocean" award and can be viewed live <a href="https://bucketeer.me/">here</a>, or view the source code <a href="https://github.com/TheBricksThatHacked/Bucketeer.me">here</a> on Github.

  <li><span class="sub-project">Connecting Hudl</span> Connecting Hudl was a project as part of Hudl's "Mind the Gap" week, a more product/process oriented version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project">Skunkworks</a> aimed towards fixing gaps in Hudl and the Hudl project. The Connecting Hudl team included <a href="https://github.com/Chastity">Chastity Grant</a>, <a href="https://github.com/majense77">Mike Jensen</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/AWendt54">Austin Wendt</a> and had three parts: a Hudl internal Chrome extension, internal "role" pages, and an internal Wiki. The Chrome extension allowed the user to pick a role ("Developer", "Designer", "QA", etc) and view a small extension window of popular links for that role along with company useful internal links. The extension stored the users role for later visits but still allowed the user to view different pages for different roles. The internal role pages displayed photos for all Hudlies working in that role along with a master list of tools and documentation needed for that role. The internal wiki was an installation of MediaWiki and during Mind the Gap the team created/wrote many company wide reaching articles. Connecting Hudl won the 2015 Mind the Gap "Best in Show" award, chosen by Hudlie vote.
  
  <li><span class= "sub-project">HudlU UX for Non-Designers Certification</span> The UX Non-Designers certification was a three week class of one hour sessions on the goals of user experience, methods and strategies of user reasearch, and validating research through sketches and prototypes. The capstone was an in-class project that involved a ten minute user interview followed by a ten minute sketch session. An overview of my final, including sketches from my sketch session, can be seen <a href="UX-Cert/index.html">here</a>.
  
  <li><span class= "sub-project">HudlU Elasticsearch Certification</span>The HudlU Elasticsearch Certification was a four week class where resident Elasticsearch Hudlie experts taught one hour sessions on querying and indexing, Operations involved in running an Elasticsearch cluster, and advanced search techniques.
